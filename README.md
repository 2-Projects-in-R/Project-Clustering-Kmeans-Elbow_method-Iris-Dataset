# Project-Clustering-PAM-Kmeans-Elbow_method-Iris-USArrests-Dataset

This GitHub repository presents an in-depth examination of clustering methods and the utilization of the elbow method to identify optimal clusters. The project is structured into two key sections, each dedicated to distinct facets of clustering analysis.

Section 1: Evaluation of Dice Distance and PAM Clustering

Section 2: Application of the Elbow Method and K-Means Clustering
